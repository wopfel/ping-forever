ping-forever
============

Pings some hosts in a loop and gives only information when the state changes

The traditional ping command is a great tool, but maybe sometimes you only want
to be informed when the state of a host changes. For this specific purpose,
you can use this script.

This script pings several hosts and prints information when 
a host is reachable that was not reachable before
and when a host is not reachable that was reachable before.
